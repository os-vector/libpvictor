# libpvictor

Project Victor Library

- `libpvictor` is a C library for communicating with the Anki Vector robot.
- It's a tiny ~60KB library which can be used to make programs which utilize the bot's hardware.
- This is essentially a fork of [torimos/poc.vic-hack](https://github.com/torimos/poc.vic-hack). I only cleaned it up and put it all into one library.
- There is a `voff` util which, when run on a bot, shuts the bot off.
